                    There are no "right" or "wrong" answers to the questions on this inventory. Your answers will help
                    to show
                    how you like to look at things and how you like to go about deciding things. Knowing your own
                    preferences
                    and learning about other people's can help you understand whether your special strenghts are, what
                    kind of
                    work you might enjoy and be successful doing, and how people with different preferences can relate
                    to each
                    other and be valuable to society. Read each question carefully and select one of the two choices
                    given,
                    which applies to you, by circling to either "A" or "B".
